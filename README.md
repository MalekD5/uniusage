# UniUsage CLI Tool


**UniUsage** is a command-line tool for analyzing user behavior from log files. It provides three core functionalities:

- ‚úÖ Estimate unique user counts per operation using **HyperLogLog** (for large datasets)
- üîç Brute-force count of unique users per operation (for small datasets)
- üî¢ Count total number of log entries with multithreading


## Installation

- **Requirement:** Java **17** or higher
- No need to run `gradlew build` before running the CLI, the script will do it for you

### Run the CLI

on Windows:
```powershell
.\uniusage.bat [command] [options]
```

on Linux/MacOS:
```bash
./uniusage.sh [command] [options]
```


## Available Commands

### `tophll`

Estimate top K operations by unique user count using **HyperLogLog**.

**Usage:**

on Windows:

```powershell
.\uniusage.bat tophll --logfile <path_to_log_file> [--k <top_k>] [--precision <hll_precision>]
```

on Linux/MacOS:

```bash
./uniusage.sh tophll --logfile <path_to_log_file> [--k <top_k>] [--precision <hll_precision>]
```

**Options:**

- `--logfile` (required): Path to the log file  
- `--k`, `--top-k`: Number of top operations to display (default: `2`)  
- `--precision`, `--hll-precision`: HLL precision (default: `18`, ~0.2% standard error)

**Note on Precision**: The higher the precision, the more accurate the estimation, but the slower the computation and the higher the memory usage.

### `top`

Brute-force method to find top K operations by unique users.  
**Best for small datasets.**

**Usage:**

on Windows:
```powershell
.\uniusage.bat top --logfile <path_to_log_file> [--k <top_k>]
```

on Linux/MacOS:
```bash
./uniusage.sh top --logfile <path_to_log_file> [--k <top_k>]
```

**Options:**

- `--logfile` (required): Path to the log file  
- `--k`, `--top-k`: Number of top operations to display (default: `2`)


### `count`

Multithreaded log processor to count **total number of entries** in the log file.

**Usage:**

on Windows:
```powershell
.\uniusage.bat count --logfile <path_to_log_file>
```

on Linux/MacOS:

```bash
./uniusage.sh count --logfile <path_to_log_file>
```

**Options:**

- `--logfile` (required): Path to the log file


## Problem Overview & Examples

We are given a log file containing user actions and asked to:

1. Identify the **top K most used operations**.
2. Determine the **percentage of users** who used each operation.
3. Ensure **each user is counted once per operation**.

## üß© Problem 1 ‚Äî Finding Top K Operations

> üßë‚Äçüíº "Can you tell me the most used two operations and the % of users who use them?"
>
> ‚úÖ Your response: "Consider it done. Each user will be counted only once per operation."

### Two Implemented Solutions

#### üî¨ 1. HyperLogLog Algorithm (Recommended for Large Logs)

```powershell
.\uniusage.bat tophll --logfile log_file.log
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Top 2 operations by unique users with standard error of 0.20%:

Operation "connect" is used by 81.23% of our users (2251 users).
Operation "filter-changed" is used by 80.01% of our users (2217 users).
```

> HLL provides high performance and low memory usage with a small error margin (¬±0.2%).



#### üõ†Ô∏è 2. Brute Force Algorithm (Accurate for Small/Medium Logs)

```powershell
.\uniusage.bat top --logfile log_file.log
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Operation "connect" is used by 81.23% of our users (2251 users).
Operation "filter-changed" is used by 80.04% of our users (2218 users).
```

> Ideal for debugging, development, and small-scale datasets.



## Problem 2 ‚Äî How Do You Verify It Works?

> üßë‚Äçüíº "How do you know your results are correct?"

- ‚úÖ I created smaller sample logs like `sm_log_file_x.log`
- üîé Manually analyzed them to find expected top operations and percentages
- üß™ Ran both brute-force and HLL implementations on the samples
- ‚úÖ Verified the outputs matched the expected results



## Problem 3 ‚Äî Changing K Easily

> üßë‚Äçüíº "Can I find the top 3 operations instead of just 2?"

Absolutely. Use the `--top-k` flag:

```powershell
.\uniusage.bat top --logfile log_file.log --top-k 3
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Operation "connect" is used by 81.23% of our users (2251 users).
Operation "filter-changed" is used by 80.04% of our users (2218 users).
Operation "open-detailed-quotes" is used by 45.11% of our users (1250 users).
```

> The CLI is flexible ‚Äî change `--top-k` to any number you need.



## Problem 4 ‚Äî Why is it Fast or Slow?

> üßë‚Äçüíº "Why is it slow? Can you make it faster?"

Yes, performance was part of the design. Here's how it‚Äôs optimized:

- üßµ **Multithreading** is used for counting entries (`count` command)
- üîç **Brute force** for accuracy in small logs
- üåÄ **HyperLogLog** for large logs with minimal memory overhead
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easy to switch between them using CLI flags
